        <h2>Specialty Coffee</h2>
        <p class="content-text">It is a project that has been implemented for over a year with <a href="https://www.elgatocafe.pl/" target="_blank">el Gato Coffee Roasters</a>, and which is constantly being developed. El Gato is a coffee roasting plant founded by a family of travelers who, during their adventures, searched for small, artisanal coffee farms in various places around the world in order to establish business contacts with them. The Specialty Coffee series is the result of these journeys. <br> <br> </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            The Specialty Coffee brand that we and el Gato have developed together with el Gato has a tradition and history that is driven by people. They have been breeding, smoking, and finally drinking coffee for hundreds of years. Hence the idea to illustrate the faces of the indigenous people, thanks to which the tradition of drinking coffee is known all over the world.

        <h2>Coffee belt</h2>

        <p class="content-text">
            The Specialty Coffee range also comes in the form of a gift called Coffee Belt. Three coffees from the three regions where coffee occurs, i.e. South America, Africa, and Oceania, together form a unique coffee belt.
