        <h2>Premium tea</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Premium tea is another project carried out together with el Gato. We wanted to put a strong graphic line between it and specialty coffee. Hence the idea for a technical or even pharmacy design. It reflects a bit about how I treat tea myself. I always prepare it with great care - I measure out the right amount of dried fruit, measure the water temperature, and use a stopwatch to keep track of the brewing time.</p>

        <h2>color</h2>
        <p class="content-text">With this project, the colors were very important to us, and more precisely that the colors should be in one tone and maintain one contrast with the white typography. You can see it very well when in Photoshop you change the mode from RGB to gray, then the border between teas disappears.</p>

        <h2>yerbito</h2>
        <p class="content-text">The Yerbito project is the first steps towards creating a uniform yerba mate brand. Looking for inspiration to make it, I started touring South America (the only region in the world where yerba mate occurs) using google maps. I came to Rio de Janeiro, where I could admire beautiful murals referring to ethnic patterns. Then I had the idea to combine them with the silhouette of a lama - just like yerba, lama is the South American endemic. The combination of all of these resulted in a beautiful box.</p>
