        <h2>Front end development</h2>
        <p class="content-text">In October 2020, I thought it would be worth having my portfolio page. In December, the website was ready. Before, I was completely green about programming. I spent long hours learning CSS, HTML to create a working draft for my site. When it came time for javascript and functionality, I was terrified. However, after a month of painstaking work, I feel quite proficient with the basic functions of the language. <br><br>
            While designing the website, I mainly used the classlist.add () or remove functions. I used timeout () or if else logic {} a couple of times. I had a lot of fun designing and coding my website, and burning my skills into the heat of the actual project, I figured this was something I would like to do daily. I think I'm on the right track.
