        <p class="text-aboutme">My name is Jakub Łączniak and I am a graphic designer with an ambition to be a front-end developer. I have been working as a freelancer for several years, and for over two years I have been a communication design specialist in my hometown of Trzebnica. In my daily work, I encounter a huge amount of very diverse tasks. Commercial graphics, preparing materials for printing, for the Internet, animation, film processing, photo retouching, illustration, branding of buildings, billboards, leaflets design, product photography, reporting, and from time to time even the work of a voice actor. In general, not so many things can surprise me, and I like this variety and I am not afraid of challenges. <br><br>

                <h2>Specialty Coffee</h2>
                <p class="content-text">It is a project that has been implemented for over a year with <a href="https://www.elgatocafe.pl/" target="_blank">el Gato Coffee Roasters</a>, and which is constantly being developed. El Gato is a coffee roasting plant founded by a family of travelers who, during their adventures, searched for small, artisanal coffee farms in various places around the world in order to establish business contacts with them. The Specialty Coffee series is the result of these journeys. <br> <br> </p>

        <div class="content-element">
            <p class="content-text">
                The Specialty Coffee brand that we and el Gato have developed together is based on a thought that in the main point of drinking coffee traditions is human being itself. Tribe people have been breeding, smoking, and finally drinking coffee for thousand of years. Hence the idea to illustrate the faces of the indigenous people, thanks to whom the tradition of drinking coffee is known all over the world.

Three coffees from the three regions where coffee occurs, i.e. South America, Africa, and Oceania, together form a unique coffee belt. The Coffee Belt won an award in the packaging category in a competition organized by <a href="https://design.sca.coffee/latest/el-gato-coffee-roasters" target="_blank">SCA Design in Coffee</a>.

            <h2>Premium tea</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Premium tea is another project carried out together with el Gato. We wanted to set a strong line between it and specialty coffee. Hence the idea for a technical or even pharmacy design. It reflects a bit about how I treat tea myself. I always prepare it with great care - I measure out the right amount of dried leaves, measure the water temperature, and use a stopwatch to keep track of the brewing time.</p>

            <h2>color</h2>
            <p class="content-text">With this project, the colors were very important to us, and more precisely that the colors should be in one tone and maintain one contrast with the white typography. You can see it very well when in Photoshop you change the mode from RGB to gray, then the border between teas disappears.</p>

            <p class="content-text">The Yerbito project is the first steps towards creating a uniform yerba mate brand. Looking for inspiration to make it, I started touring South America (the only region in the world where yerba mate occurs) using google maps. I came to Rio de Janeiro, where I could admire beautiful murals referring to ethnic patterns. Then I had the idea to combine them with the silhouette of a lama - just like yerba, lama is the South American endemic. The combination of all of these resulted in a beautiful box.</p>

It did not suit me a bit, but it was successful in terms of both graphics and, in the long term, also business.

            <p class="content-text">Recently, my city has undergone a revitalization of the city's information carriers. I had the pleasure to design the layout that is currently valid on all city boards. The combination of lime and blue colors looks great in print and refers to the coat of arms of Trzebnica, and the use of icons in the upper right corner allows you to identify at a glance what kind of plaque we are dealing with (park, church, hospital etc.)</p>

            <p class="content-text">The case with the public transport plaque was very complicated. While line A is simple - the bus runs on a circular route all the time, line B was one big chaos. The B line bus never makes the same loop. He goes to different places all day long. Hence, my timetable is based on the timeline. During the design process I was making few interviews with city residents to see if the understand my design. I wasn't sure about it, but it turned out to be a success. The project was also my final thesis during my studies in UX classes.

            <h2>The communal sports <br> and recreational facility</h2>
            <p class="content-text">The communal sports and recreational facility communicates with residents mainly through posters (it has showcases located throughout the city and on social media). Due to the variety of classes, it was difficult for me to achieve graphic uniformity. The only element that binds the individual posters together is the gray beams at the top and bottom of the poster as well as subdued, pastel colors. Although the object lacks total graphic consistency, I am very happy with the posters. It also translated into commercial success (obviously I don't think that my design was the main factor).</p>

            <p class="content-text">Graphic design is my main source of income. Painting and drawing are more of a hobby. After all, design and painting are, in my opinion, closely related. They influence each other and develop each other. For this reason, when I started my career as a graphic designer (about four years ago), I promised myself that I would draw or paint for at least an hour every day. Believe it or not, I haven't missed a single day.</p>

        <p class="content-text">I do most of my work in digital, but I often warm up by working with a pencil. The main theme of my pencil work is human anatomy. I love to draw people, especially women because they have the natural beauty of lines and rhythms - it is not surprising that the old masters painted them so often. Here are some of my recent sketches. Most are not very good, as they are usually five minutes.

As with painting, I don't make money from these drawings. I treat them more as a hobby and a way to develop his graphic design skills. I just love to draw.</p>

            <h2>Front end development</h2>
            <p class="content-text">In October 2020, I thought it would be worth having my portfolio page. In December, the website was ready. Before, I was completely green about programming. I spent long hours learning CSS, HTML to create a working draft for my site. When it came time for javascript and functionality, I was terrified. However, after a month of painstaking work, I feel quite proficient with the basic functions of the language. <br><br>
                While designing the website, I mainly used the classlist.add () or remove functions. I used timeout () or if-else logic {} a couple of times. I had a lot of fun designing and coding my website. I've burned my basic skills into the fire of the actual project. I figured out that this is something I would like to do daily. I think I'm on the right track. <br><br>
